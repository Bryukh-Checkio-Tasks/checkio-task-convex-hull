    Given a list of points on a coordinate plane, find the convex hull formed by these points.
    The convex hull of a set X of points in the Euclidean plane is the smallest convex set that contains X.
    For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape
    formed by a rubber band stretched around X. If a point lies on edge, it's included.
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">You can read more about a convex hull on Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>The points are presented as a list of coordinates -- [x, y], in which x and y are integers.
    The result returns as a sequence of indexes of points in the given list; points lie on the convex hull in clockwise
    order (see picture).
    The sequence starts from the leftmost point, but if there are several such points,
    then start from the bottom-most left of them.(Example [[1, 1], [1, 2], [2,0]] - start from [1, 1] -- index 0).
    Remember: You should return a list of indexes--not the points themselves.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    The problem of finding convex hulls finds its practical applications in pattern recognition, image processing,
    statistics, GIS and static code analysis by abstract interpretation. It also serves as a tool, a building block for
    a number of other computational-geometric algorithms such as the rotating calipers method for computing the width
    and diameter of a point set.
